CONTEXT AND CONTINUITY. Fifth and LAST lesson of chapter 8, Inequalities. It closes the chapter.
- 8.1 gave the rules, 8.2 compared two numbers, 8.3 solved a linear inequality in one variable,
  8.4 drew the solutions, as a ray on a number line and as a half-plane in the plane, and found the
  overlap of several half-planes together with the corners where boundaries cross. 8.4's EXACT
  shipped closer is: "Every region in this lesson was drawn and then read, for a count of the
  points inside it or for one corner. Nothing here asked which point of a region is the best one.
  Lesson 8.5, Optimization, asks exactly that, and the corners found here are the points to check."
  The opener keeps that promise in one or two plain sentences, answering the question the closer
  posed. Do NOT write "Last lesson we" or "Imagine".
- CHAPTER 5 and 7.6 both know how to find where two lines cross, which is how a corner is found
  here. Do NOT re-derive it.

TOPIC CHECKLIST (cover ALL):
 1. WHAT OPTIMIZATION ASKS. Not "what values work" but "of the values that work, which is largest",
    and the answer is a single number. Say that plainly at the start.
 2. THE TWO-PART ANSWER, which is the whole idea of the lesson and its hardest habit to build.
    Showing \\(x\\le 7\\) does NOT show that \\(7\\) is the maximum, only that nothing beats it.
    A maximum needs BOTH parts, a bound saying it cannot be exceeded AND a case showing the bound
    is actually reached. State this early, use it everywhere, and include a problem where a
    plausible bound is NOT attainable so the true maximum is smaller.
 3. BOUNDING A SINGLE VARIABLE. Rearranging a constraint into the form \\(x\\le\\) some number, then
    checking that the number is achievable.
 4. WHEN THE BOUND IS NOT ATTAINABLE because a quantity must be a WHOLE NUMBER. If \\(n\\le 7.4\\)
    and \\(n\\) counts objects, the maximum is \\(7\\), not \\(7.4\\). Include this explicitly,
    because it is the most common real version of the two-part answer.
 5. SEVERAL CONSTRAINTS AT ONCE on one variable. Every constraint gives a bound, and the binding
    one is the tightest. The maximum is the smallest of the upper bounds.
 6. OPTIMIZING A LINEAR EXPRESSION OVER A REGION. With two variables under a list of linear
    constraints, the largest and smallest values of a linear expression occur AT A CORNER of the
    region. State it as a usable fact, justify it by noting that moving along any edge changes the
    expression steadily so an interior point of an edge can never beat both of its ends, and then
    use it. Do NOT attempt a full proof.
 7. THE METHOD. Find the corners by intersecting boundary pairs, evaluate the expression at each,
    and take the best. One problem must run the full method on a region with three or four corners.
 8. MINIMIZING is the same work with the other end taken.

SCOPE BOUNDARY:
- Do NOT re-derive 8.1's rules, 8.3's isolation, or 8.4's half-plane picture. All are used.
- Do NOT teach the simplex method or anything algorithmic beyond checking every corner.
- Nothing quadratic, no absolute value. The closer hands off to chapter 9, Quadratics I, Factoring,
  opening with 9.1.

ANSWER SHAPE. Every answer is a SINGLE typed value, which optimization gives naturally, since the
answer to "what is the largest possible value" IS one number. Other good asks are the value of the
expression at the best corner, one coordinate of the corner where the best value occurs, the number
of corners of a region, or the largest whole number of items. Never ask for a region, a pair, or an
explanation. Every answer is an integer or a lowest-terms fraction, never a rounded decimal, and
when the answer must be a whole number the problem must say what is being counted.

MANDATED BLOCK OUTLINE, exactly 25 blocks in exactly this order:
  1 [op] p opener      2 [P1] prob bound one variable and check the bound is reached
  3 [P2] prob a bound that is NOT reached, so the true maximum is smaller
  4 [imp1] imp a maximum needs a bound AND a case reaching it
  5 [P3] prob a whole-number quantity forcing the bound down
  6 [P4] prob several constraints, the tightest one binding
  7 [imp2] imp the smallest of the upper bounds is the one that binds
  8 [FIG] fig a region with its corners marked, and the best corner picked out
  9 [p_two] p two variables at once
  10 [P5] prob a corner found by intersecting two boundaries
  11 [P6] prob how many corners a stated region has. The figure at slot 8 draws a five-corner
     region, so P6's region must NOT have five corners, or its answer could be read off the picture
  12 [imp3] imp the best value of a linear expression sits at a corner, and why
  13 [p_region] p the method end to end
  14 [P7] prob evaluate at every corner and take the best
  15 [fact] fact George Dantzig, see below
  16 [P8] prob a minimum rather than a maximum
  17 [imp4] imp the method, and minimizing as the same work
  18 [p_int] p when the answer has to be a whole number
  19 [P9] prob a whole-number optimum inside a region
  20 [P10] prob a context where the binding constraint is not the obvious one
  21 [imp5] imp whole-number constraints, and checking attainability at the end
  22 [p_close] p putting the chapter together
  23 [P11] prob the full method on a four-corner region
  24 [P12] prob the hardest closer
  25 [closer] p closes chapter 8 and hands off to chapter 9, Quadratics I, Factoring, opening with 9.1

Plus a review array of 17 items [R1] to [R17], easy to hard, standing alone.

FIGURE (slot FIG): the rendered artwork is built separately with manim and swapped in later, so
your job for this slot is a clean, correct placeholder SVG plus the real caption. One shaded region
in the first quadrant bounded by straight edges, each corner marked by a dot, and ONE corner picked
out in gold with a short lowercase label reading "best here". The picture must say that only the
corners need checking. Use LETTERS for the boundaries and put NO DIGITS in the figure. One hard
constraint that matters because dots can be counted: the region in the figure must have FIVE
corners, and P6's answer, together with the corner count of every other stated region in the
lesson, must NOT be five, so counting the figure's dots answers nothing. Lowercase labels only,
no sentence inside the SVG, all prose in cap.

HISTORICAL FACT (slot fact): already spent and BANNED: Cardano, Servois, Hamilton, Viete,
Descartes, Stifel, Wallis, Oresme, Rudolff, the Pythagoreans, Recorde, al-Khwarizmi, Fibonacci,
Bhaskara II, Diophantus, the Babylonian tablets, the Chinese Nine Chapters, Simon Stevin, Alcuin
of York, Gauss, Eudoxus, the metre and Delambre and Mechain, the Roman centesima rerum venalium,
the origin of the percent sign, Boyle, Kepler, Fermat, William Playfair, Gaspard Monge, Johann
Heinrich Lambert, Edmond Halley, Euclid's fifth postulate with Lobachevsky and Bolyai, Thomas
Harriot, Pierre Bouguer, Joseph Fourier, and Leonid Kantorovich. Use George Dantzig, who arrived
late to a class in 1939, copied two problems off the board as homework, and handed in solutions to
what were in fact two open questions nobody had answered. About 200 characters.

NUMBER AND ANSWER FRESHNESS: (a) no two problems share a full number set, (b) the figure carries no
digits, (c) every answer in the lesson is distinct from every other, (d) every answer is exact.
`

const STYLE = `
QUANTICA HOUSE STYLE (follow exactly):
- QUALITY BAR: read lessons/prealgebra/chapter-1.json, all six lessons, for problem quality and
  pedagogy. Problems teach rather than test, each placed so working it makes the next idea
  obvious, and the idea arrives AFTER the problems that earned it. Rules get derived twice by
  independent routes, never asserted. Do NOT copy chapter 1's mechanics, which predate the
  conventions below (1-hint problems, xp to 18, single-$ math). Take its problem design only.
- Voice: problem-first, plainspoken, warm but tight, exactly like AoPS. Read
  lessons/prealgebra/chapter-2.json (2.1, 2.2) for the prose length and register bar, and the
  already-authored lessons of this course for continuity of voice and notation.
- NO em-dashes. Almost NO colons in prose. NO poetic/abstract register: no strings or readers as
  characters, no personified conventions, no cute renamings, no dramatized verbs. Say the plain
  thing. A metaphor survives only if it teaches.
- EQUATIONS, LETTERS, NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES DO NOT ACT. Never write that a system "hands over" a
  coefficient, an equation "arrives", a letter "qualifies", fractions "ride through" lines, a pair
  "fixes" a dimension, or a method is a "recipe". State the fact directly. If a sentence gives a
  verb of agency to a mathematical object, rewrite it. Clarity first, conversation second.
- DEFINE, DO NOT METAPHOR. An explanatory block states plainly what the thing IS, names the term
  in the sentence where it first appears, and gives the concrete consequence rather than gesturing
  that it matters. Say it once and stop. "That is what gives", "which is exactly what makes" and
  "the real power of" are defective openings.
- NO all-caps eyebrow, kicker, tag or band labels anywhere, including inside SVG figures.
- Math in \\( ... \\) inline, $$ ... $$ display. SINGLE backslashes. Bold with <b>...</b>.
- INEQUALITY SYMBOLS INSIDE MATH ARE ALWAYS \\lt AND \\gt, NEVER A BARE < OR >. A raw < followed
  by a letter is eaten by the HTML parser as a tag before KaTeX ever sees it, so the rest of the
  sentence silently vanishes and NO error is raised. This already shipped a broken lesson once in
  this chapter. Write \\(4\\lt x\\le 9\\), never \\(4<x\\le 9\\). Applies in x, hints,
  sol, accept and cap alike. \\le and \\ge are already safe.
- Lengths (chars in x): p 200-350; imp 350-600 (bold rule name + statement + the WHY);
  fact ~200; prob 120-250, up to ~450 if the ask needs pinning down.
- Figures: font-family "Space Grotesk, sans-serif", font-weight max 700, viewBox width 560-600,
  explicit hex palette (blue #2f6fe0 / #2257c5 / #3b82f6, gold #fcd76a / #e0a52a / #8a5a08,
  grey #eef1f6 / #dbe1ea / #aab4c2, slate #475569, hairline #e4e9f1), role="img" plus aria-label,
  lowercase band labels, labels only, all prose in cap.
- ORIGINALITY IS REQUIRED. Invent fresh numbers and framings. If a reference text is mentioned it
  is a coverage and difficulty checklist ONLY; never mirror its examples, numbers or sequence.

GRADING RULES:
- prob block: {"t":"prob","xp":5-8,"x","ans","accept":[...],"hints":[exactly 2],"sol"}
- review item: same but NO t and NO xp fields, and still exactly 2 hints.
- Answers are a SINGLE typed value. The grader (normAns) trims, lowercases, strips spaces and
  commas, and drops a leading plus. It ALSO maps the unicode minus and the en/em dashes onto
  ASCII '-', strips a leading '$', and folds a mixed number like "1 1/2" onto "3/2". So a
  negative answer needs ONLY the ASCII spelling, and a separate unicode-minus entry is dead
  weight the grader can never reach. Never add the whitespace-stripped form of a mixed number
  ("21/2" for "2 1/2"); that now denotes ten and a half and grades a wrong answer correct.
  accept must contain ans plus every reasonable typed variant (word form, exact terminating
  decimal for a fraction, unit spellings).
- EXACTLY ONE ANSWER. A prompt that admits several correct values is broken even when accept
  covers them all, because two students can both be right and type different numbers. Never
  write "give a counterexample", "name a factor", or "find a number such that" when many
  qualify, and never join two questions into one answer box. Pin it with a slick move instead,
  the smallest or largest such value, the sum of all of them over a stated range, their
  product, how many there are, or how many digits the result has. The slick move usually makes
  the problem better, since it forces the student to characterise the whole family rather than
  stop at the first example.
- hints are 2, specific to that problem, never generic. The first reframes, the second gets
  concrete without handing over the answer.
- SOLUTIONS ARE ANSWER-FIRST, in two parts. Part 1 does the problem directly and closes ON
  \\(\\boxed{...}\\) inside \\( \\) or $$, with nothing trailing after the box in that sentence.
  Part 2 is optional, one or two short sentences AFTER the box giving the insight or the common
  mistake, ~180 chars, hard cap ~320. Whole sol: easy ~120-320, moderate ~250-450, hard ~350-600.
